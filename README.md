# Coffee-Shop-Sales-Analysis

This project explores and analyzes coffee sales data to uncover insights about product performance, customer preferences, seasonal trends, and regional sales patterns. The goal is to help stakeholders make data-driven decisions to boost profitability and optimize inventory management.
Espresso is the highest-selling product across all regions.

Sales peak during winter months (Octoberâ€“December).

North region accounts for 35% of total revenue.

A noticeable decline in sales during summer suggests potential for cold beverage promotions.
